Iris Flower Classification 🌸
This project involves classifying iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on the length and width of their petals and sepals. As part of my Data Science Internship at CodSoft, this classic supervised learning task helped me understand fundamental machine learning workflows and model evaluation.

📌 Objective
To build a classification model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower using its features. This is a multi-class classification problem using the well-known Iris dataset.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution plots of all features
Pairplots and scatter matrices to understand feature relationships
Class balance analysis
Correlation heatmap to identify feature importance
🛠️ Model Building
Trained multiple models using scikit-learn:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
📈 Model Evaluation
Used the following metrics to evaluate model performance:

Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
Cross-validation (optional)
